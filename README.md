# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a simple movie recommendation model that uses a content-based approach. The model is built using Python and utilizes a dataset from Kaggle to recommend movies based on their content.

## Features

- Recommends movies based on content similarity.
- Uses metadata such as genres, keywords, and other attributes to find similar movies.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about movies such as titles, genres, keywords, and other relevant metadata.

    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MovieRecommendationSystem.git
    cd MovieRecommendationSystem
    \`\`\`

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    \`\`\`bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    \`\`\`


## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
    - Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.
    - Ensure the dataset is named appropriately and is in the correct format.
